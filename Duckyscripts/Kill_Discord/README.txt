Kill_Discord is a duckyscript that does exactly what the name implies.

As of April 2024 the string "http://./\<#0>:  ://./<#0>" without the quotes will crash your Discord client when pasted into any message box.

This script opens Discord on the target machine and pastes that string into the first available text box.

Just to reitterate this crashes the Discord client of the SENDER, hence the need for a duckyscript.

As always, don't be a skid, and only use these scripts on devices which you are expresely authorized to use them on. I am not liable for any unauthorized usage or damage caused by the usage of this tool.
